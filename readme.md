# Automatic License Plate Reader (ANPR) System

## Overview
This project was carried out during my academic internship as a part of the corporate Gurukul's Global Academic Internship Program (GAIP) in collaboration with the National University of Singapore and Hewlett Packard Enterprise from June to July 2022. The program focused on Data Analytics using Deep Learning. As the team leader, I oversaw the development of an Automatic License Plate Reader (ANPR) system. 

## Project Description
The ANPR system was designed to automatically identify and read license plates from various vehicles. This is a critical aspect of many applications such as toll collection, parking access control, and traffic law enforcement.

We used the YOLO v5 model for object detection, specifically for locating the license plates in images. For Optical Character Recognition (OCR), we designed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that was trained to recognize and interpret the alphanumeric characters on license plates.

## Deployment
The entire ANPR system was deployed on Azure Cloud. This allowed us to leverage the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing, ensuring that our system could handle a large number of requests efficiently.

## Future Work
We aim to further improve the accuracy of the ANPR system and expand its capabilities to handle license plates from different countries and regions, accommodating different license plate designs and formats.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the faculty at NUS and professionals at HPE for their guidance and insights during the course of this internship program.
